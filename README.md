**GuessWho** is a command-line tool (CLI) and .NET class library that allows you to determine what kind of application a given .NET assembly is ‚Äî for example, whether it's a console app, ASP.NET app, Windows Forms, WPF, Worker Service, and more.

The tool analyzes the metadata and dependencies of a `.dll` or `.exe` to identify the runtime context (e.g., web app, desktop app, Windows service, etc.). This can be useful when writing libraries that need to adjust their behavior depending on the host application type.

The `GuessWho.App` is packaged as a global .NET CLI tool, and `GuessWho.Library` is a reusable class library for integration into your own .NET code.

## Installation

- **CLI**:
  ```bash
  dotnet tool install -g DH.GuessWho.Tool
  ```

- **Library**:
  ```bash
  dotnet add package DH.GuessWho.Library
  ```

## Usage (CLI)

```bash
dotnet guesswho <path_to_assembly> [options]
```

- `-n`, `--no-logo` ‚Äì Suppress the banner
- `--version` ‚Äì Display version information
- `--help` ‚Äì Show usage help

Example:
```bash
dotnet guesswho .\src\Example\ClientService\bin\net8.0\ClientService.dll
